Hi! I'm currently working on building my own GPT based on the famous paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762).

For now, this repository contains:

- Python Notebook of a decoder-only transformer following the code from [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture).

The goal is to ace all the suggested exercises and create a [main entry point website](https://harvestwalukow.github.io/gpt/) as a central hub for information and documentation related to this project.
